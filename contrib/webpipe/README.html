<h1>WebPipe</h1>
<p><code>webpipe</code>
is a companion web front-end for <a href="http://newspipe.sf.net">newspipe</a>
that allows you to keep track of read news items, flag items for
follow-up and generate a &ldquo;metafeed&rdquo; of all your
news that you can view on a PDA or on any web browser.</p>
<p>It was designed to run on
pretty much any web server running a stock install of PHP (requiring
nothing more than the IMAP extension), under any sort of user account,
and in close relationship to <a href="http://newspipe.sf.net">newspipe</a>
(it takes a few shortcuts to parse and display <a
 href="http://newspipe.sf.net">newspipe</a>&rsquo;s
specific MIME format).</p>

<h2>Changelog:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2005-12-01: <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Another overhaul of the
authentication mechanism to deal with PlayStation Portable
authentication bugs (we now use PHP sessions and a single
authentication request).<br>
    </li>
    <li>Removed requirement for
PATH_INFO (arguments are now sent as part of a standard query string).</li>
  </ul>
  <li>2005-09-20:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">$gaProfileOverrides</span>
to disable rotation and set image sizes for specific user-agents (see <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">config.php.sample</span>
for an example)</li>
    <li>Added metatags for RSS feed.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>2005-05-12:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Major overhaul of
authentication mechanism to deal with Blackberry bugs and allow for
more flexible ACL specification. You can now allow unauthenticated
access to some user-agents, IP addresses, etc.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Several other tweaks.
Default installation now logs all authentication steps.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>You need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PHP (4.3.4 or above) with
IMAP support compiled in - see <a
 href="http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/">Entropy</a>
if you want to run this on a Mac.</li>
  <li>A working installation of <a href="http://newspipe.sf.net">newspipe</a>.
You do want something to read, right?</li>
  <li>A fast network link to your
IMAP server (remember that <code>webpipe</code>
will be fetching messages on the fly).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Place all the PHP files
where your Web server can process them.</li>
  <li>Make sure that your Web
server can write to a file called <span style="font-family: monospace;">devices.dat</span>
in<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">/tmp</span>
(that's where WAP device profiles are summarized and stored).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Open <code>config.php.sample</code>
and edit it to your liking, saving it as <code>config.php</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>Since the IMAP password
has to be stored in clear text, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to put <code>config.php</code>
outside the web root and change <code>main.php</code>
accordingly (that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s separate from <code>main.php</code>).</li>
      <li>You can change the
folder webpipe reads from by modifying the <code>MAILBOX</code>
variable. See the <a
 href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imap-open.php">imap_open</a>
documentation for details.</li>
      <li>As a fail-safe, <code>webpipe</code>
does NOT delete messages. It does, however, move them to the <code>Trash</code>
folder or to another folder of your own choosing. Check if that folder
exists and matches what is defined in <code>config.php</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modify the usernames in <code>config.php</code>
to ones of your own liking - at the very least, create a new password
using <span style="font-family: monospace;">echo
-n "your new password" | md5sum</span><code></code>
(use <code>md5</code>
if you're on a Mac).&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
  <li>What&rsquo;s the point
of accessing your IMAP store to read RSS feeds? Isn&rsquo;t
straight e-mail/MMS enough with <a href="http://newspipe.sf.net">newspipe</a>?</li>
  <dt>
    <p>Actually, no.
Let&rsquo;s
say you&rsquo;re out with your PDA and want to keep up with the
news, but only have Web access. Using <code>webpipe</code>,
you can quickly check your latest newspipe items, flag messages for
follow-up and delete the ones you&rsquo;re not interested in.
    </p>
  </dt>
  <li><code>webpipe</code>
won&rsquo;t display regular mail!</li>
  <dt>
    <p>Of course not. <code>webpipe</code>
is a very simple IMAP-to-web shim that only understands <a
 href="http://newspipe.sf.net">newspipe</a>&rsquo;s
simple MIME structure.</p>
  </dt>
  <li>Is there a WAP version?</li>
  <dt>
    <p>No, and there isn't likely to be a "pure" WML version from me.
The templates and
code were kept simple enough so that a WAP version can be put together
with
minimal fuss (provided someone codes the required encoding and content
paging logic). The original version of <code>webpipe</code>
used XSLT transforms with an intent to accomplish that, but I
couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to maintain it when just about every
mobile browser out there now supports XHTML in some fashion.<br>
    </p>
  </dt>
  <li>Can I use it with a POP
account?</li>
  <dt>
    <p>Most likely not.
PHP&rsquo;s <a
 href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imap-open.php">imap_open</a>
supports POP3, but some of the operations won't be supported by the POP
server.</p>
  </dt>
  <li>What devices has <code>webpipe</code>
been tested with?</li>
  <dt>
    <p>Here's an incomplete list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Playstation Portable
(firmware versions 2.0 to 2.6)<br>
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://mini.opera.com">Opera Mini</a><br>
