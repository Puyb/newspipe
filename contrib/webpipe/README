WebPipe
=======

`webpipe` is a companion web front-end for [newspipe][2] that allows you to keep track of read news items, flag items for follow-up and generate a "metafeed" of all your news that you can view on a PDA or on any web browser.

It was designed to run on pretty much any web server running a stock install of PHP (requiring nothing more than the IMAP extension), under any sort of user account, and in close relationship to [newspipe][2] (it takes a few shortcuts to parse and display [newspipe][2]'s specific MIME format).

Requirements
------------

You need:

* PHP (4.3.4 or above, see [Entropy][1] if you want to run this on a Mac) with IMAP support compiled in.
* A working knowledge of how to protect this script using HTTP authentication (.htaccess or similar), since `webpipe` DOES NOT DO AUTHENTICATION - it relies on your web server (preferably [Apache][7] do do it.
* A working installation of [newspipe][2]. You do want something to read, right?
* Quick access to your IMAP server (remember that `webpipe` will be fetching messages on the fly).

Configuration
-------------

* Place all the PHP files where your Web server can process them.
* Open `config.php.sample` and edit it to your liking, saving it as `config.php`.
  * Since the IMAP password has to be stored in clear text, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to put `config.php` outside the web root and change `main.php` accordingly (that's why it's separate from `main.php`).
  * You can change the folder webpipe reads from by modifying the `MAILBOX` variable. See the [imap_open][5] documentation for details.
  * As a fail-safe, `webpipe` does NOT delete messages. It does, however, move them to the `Trash` folder or to another folder of your own choosing. Check if that folder exists and matches what is defined in `config.php`.
* Make sure your web server supports `PATH_INFO`. [Apache][6] is pretty straightforward to configure for this - you can enable it via an `.htaccess` file like so:

    <Files "*.php">
      AcceptPathInfo On
    </Files>

* Finally, protect your `webpipe` install with an username and password. Again, check the [Apache][7] documentation for this.

FAQ
---

* What's the point of accessing your IMAP store to read RSS feeds? Isn't straight e-mail/MMS enough with [newspipe][2]?

Actually, no. Let's say you're out with your PDA and want to keep up with the news, but only have Web access. Using `webpipe`, you can quickly check your latest newspipe items, flag messages for follow-up and delete the ones you're not interested in. 

* `webpipe` won't display regular mail!

Of course not. `webpipe` is a very simple IMAP-to-web shim that only understands [newspipe][2]'s simple MIME structure.

* Is there a WAP version?

Not yet. The templates and code were kept simple enough so that a WAP version can be put together with minimal fuss (provided someone codes the required encoding and content paging logic). The original version of `webpipe` used XSLT transforms with an intent to accomplish that, but I couldn't be bothered.

* Can I use it with a POP account?

Most likely not. PHP's [imap_open][5] supports POP3, but some of the operations (deleting, )

* Why `PATH_INFO`?

Well, because the URLs are simpler and mostly because my Blackberry would choke on multi-parameter GETs for some reason. This way it doesn't have to understand what it's doing.

* What PDAs has `webpipe` been tested with?

One of each, basically:

  * RIM Blackberry 7230
  * RIM Blackberry 7100v
  * Pocket PC (works with any version, although there are occasional issues with UTF-8)
  * Palm Tungsten T3 (previous version worked with WebPro, should work fine with Blazer)

`webpipe` wouldn't have sprung into life without Ricardo M. Reyes' [newspipe][2]. [Bruno David][3] changed [newspipe][2]'s MIME structure to what it is today.
