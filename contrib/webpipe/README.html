<h1>WebPipe</h1>

<p><code>webpipe</code> is a companion web front-end for <a href="http://newspipe.sf.net">newspipe</a> that allows you to keep track of read news items, flag items for follow-up and generate a &#8220;metafeed&#8221; of all your news that you can view on a PDA or on any web browser.</p>

<p>It was designed to run on pretty much any web server running a stock install of PHP (requiring nothing more than the IMAP extension), under any sort of user account, and in close relationship to <a href="http://newspipe.sf.net">newspipe</a> (it takes a few shortcuts to parse and display <a href="http://newspipe.sf.net">newspipe</a>&#8217;s specific MIME format).</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>You need:</p>

<ul>
<li>PHP (4.3.4 or above, see <a href="http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/">Entropy</a> if you want to run this on a Mac) with IMAP support compiled in.</li>
<li>A working knowledge of how to protect this script using HTTP authentication (.htaccess or similar), since <code>webpipe</code> DOES NOT DO AUTHENTICATION - it relies on your web server (preferably <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#require">Apache</a> do do it.</li>
<li>A working installation of <a href="http://newspipe.sf.net">newspipe</a>. You do want something to read, right?</li>
<li>Quick access to your IMAP server (remember that <code>webpipe</code> will be fetching messages on the fly).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<ul>
<li>Place all the PHP files where your Web server can process them.</li>
<li>Open <code>config.php.sample</code> and edit it to your liking, saving it as <code>config.php</code>.
<ul>
<li>Since the IMAP password has to be stored in clear text, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to put <code>config.php</code> outside the web root and change <code>main.php</code> accordingly (that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s separate from <code>main.php</code>).</li>
<li>You can change the folder webpipe reads from by modifying the <code>MAILBOX</code> variable. See the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imap-open.php">imap_open</a> documentation for details.</li>
<li>As a fail-safe, <code>webpipe</code> does NOT delete messages. It does, however, move them to the <code>Trash</code> folder or to another folder of your own choosing. Check if that folder exists and matches what is defined in <code>config.php</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Make sure your web server supports <code>PATH_INFO</code>. <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#acceptpathinfo">Apache</a> is pretty straightforward to configure for this - you can enable it via an <code>.htaccess</code> file like so:</p>

<p><Files "*.php">
  AcceptPathInfo On
</Files></p></li>
<li><p>Finally, protect your <code>webpipe</code> install with an username and password. Again, check the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#require">Apache</a> documentation for this.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<ul>
<li>What&#8217;s the point of accessing your IMAP store to read RSS feeds? Isn&#8217;t straight e-mail/MMS enough with <a href="http://newspipe.sf.net">newspipe</a>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Actually, no. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re out with your PDA and want to keep up with the news, but only have Web access. Using <code>webpipe</code>, you can quickly check your latest newspipe items, flag messages for follow-up and delete the ones you&#8217;re not interested in. </p>

<ul>
<li><code>webpipe</code> won&#8217;t display regular mail!</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course not. <code>webpipe</code> is a very simple IMAP-to-web shim that only understands <a href="http://newspipe.sf.net">newspipe</a>&#8217;s simple MIME structure.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a WAP version?</li>
</ul>

<p>Not yet. The templates and code were kept simple enough so that a WAP version can be put together with minimal fuss (provided someone codes the required encoding and content paging logic). The original version of <code>webpipe</code> used XSLT transforms with an intent to accomplish that, but I couldn&#8217;t be bothered.</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I use it with a POP account?</li>
</ul>

<p>Most likely not. PHP&#8217;s <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imap-open.php">imap_open</a> supports POP3, but some of the operations (deleting, )</p>

<ul>
<li>Why <code>PATH_INFO</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, because the URLs are simpler and mostly because my Blackberry would choke on multi-parameter GETs for some reason. This way it doesn&#8217;t have to understand what it&#8217;s doing.</p>

<ul>
<li>What PDAs has <code>webpipe</code> been tested with?</li>
</ul>

<p>One of each, basically:</p>

<ul>
<li>RIM Blackberry 7230</li>
<li>RIM Blackberry 7100v</li>
<li>Pocket PC (works with any version, although there are occasional issues with UTF-8)</li>
<li>Palm Tungsten T3 (previous version worked with WebPro, should work fine with Blazer)</li>
</ul>
